# Go Concurrency Playground

Welcome to the **Go Concurrency Playground**! 🚀 

This repository is dedicated to exploring concurrency in Go. It contains solutions to sample problems commonly encountered in technical interviews, alongside concepts and patterns used in real-world applications. The goal is to strengthen your understanding of Go's concurrency model and its powerful primitives.

## Features
- 📚 **Concurrency Basics**: Simple examples to grasp Go's concurrency fundamentals.
- 💡 **Common Interview Patterns**: Implementations of producer-consumer, dining philosophers, fan-in/fan-out, and more.
- 🛠️ **Practical Challenges**: Real-world inspired problems using channels, goroutines, and `sync` primitives.
- 🧪 **Test Coverage**: Includes unit tests for every solution.
